# Comparison TABLES, not long paragraphs
Problem: a wall-of-text paragraph is hard to eyeball; the user rejected this twice.
Fix: convert any comparison of 3+ items or 2+ dimensions into a TABLE (or short bullet lines); add an emoji to every row; keep standalone prose to 1-2 line lead-ins. (Working docs only; a published survey `.tex` keeps academic prose.)
