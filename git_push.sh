Git Push Script - Multi-Account Support (CODE PUSH ONLY)
=============================================================================

Pushes code to GitHub only. The HF outputs-upload step was REMOVED (2026-05-30) —
this script no longer touches HuggingFace, so a forgotten flag can never trigger a
slow/destructive HF sync. Credentials (per-account GitHub PATs) are loaded from the
gitignored .env (GITHUB_TOKEN_KAPIL / GITHUB_TOKEN_GAYTRI) — never hardcoded here.

Usage:
    chmod +x git_push.sh           # make it executable (once)
    bash git_push.sh "updating"    # commit + push code (no flags — --code-only was removed)

To back up outputs/ to HF MANUALLY (separate, opt-in — no longer part of this script):
    python -u src/utils/hf_outputs.py upload outputs 2>&1 | tee logs/hf_upload_outputs_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log

Example:
    % ./git_push.sh "testing git push"
    Select account:
    1) Kapil
    2) Gaytri
    Enter choice [1/2]: 1
    ...
    Pushed as Kapil
    Done (code push only)
