# Suggested Reviewers: "Weights or Skills?" (ACM Computing Surveys)

> For the ScholarOne "suggested reviewers" field (CSUR recommends 4+). All candidates were
> web-verified against 2025-2026 affiliations and screened against the authors' institutions
> (UC Berkeley, San Jose State, Meta, Apple, PocketFM, BITS Pilani Goa). **Before entering into ScholarOne you must:**
> - [ ] Confirm each person's CURRENT affiliation and look up their email from their lab page
>       (affiliations in this field change often).
> - [ ] Confirm none is your advisor, recent co-author, or close collaborator (only you can check
>       this; it is the COI dimension the web scan cannot see).
> - [ ] Keep the final list spread across institutions to avoid a one-lab-network flag.

## Recommended slate (6, COI-clean and well spread)

This subset covers both poles and all six coverage areas, spans six institutions across three
regions, and deliberately **avoids the NVIDIA / GEAR and Physical Intelligence entanglements**
flagged below (important because the manuscript spotlights ASPIRE, an NVIDIA GEAR system). None of
the six is at an author institution (UC Berkeley, San Jose State, Meta, Apple, PocketFM, BITS Pilani).

| # | Name | Current affiliation | Reviews (coverage area) | Representative work | Link |
|---|------|---------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|------|
| 1 | **Xiaolong Wang** | UC San Diego | VLA / generalist policies (weights pole) | GenSim; generalist manipulation policies | https://xiaolonw.github.io/ |
| 2 | **Animesh Garg** | Georgia Tech | code-as-policy / LLM robotics (skills pole) | ProgPrompt (2022/23) | https://animesh.garg.tech/ |
| 3 | **Dinesh Jayaraman** | Univ. of Pennsylvania (GRASP) | LLM reward design / LLM+RL | Eureka (2024) | https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/ |
| 4 | **Benjamin Eysenbach** | Princeton | unsupervised skill discovery / HRL | DIAYN (2019) | https://ben-eysenbach.github.io/ |
| 5 | **Jan Peters** | TU Darmstadt + DFKI (Germany) | hierarchical RL / skill libraries; senior gravitas | Reinforcement Learning in Robotics: A Survey (2013) | http://www.jan-peters.net/ |
| 6 | **Huazhe Xu** | Tsinghua (IIIS, China) | LLM-for-robot code / skill discovery | GenSim (ICLR 2024) | http://hxu.rocks/ |

**Regions:** US (UCSD, Georgia Tech, UPenn, Princeton), Europe (TU Darmstadt), Asia (Tsinghua).
**Poles covered:** weights (Wang), skills/code-as-policy (Garg, Xu), reward synthesis (Jayaraman),
skill discovery / HRL (Eysenbach, Peters).

## Strong but ENTANGLED with a surveyed system (use only after checking)

- **Jim (Linxi) Fan** (NVIDIA, co-lead GEAR / GR00T) covers the agentic/self-improving pole
  (Voyager). But **GEAR is the lab behind ASPIRE**, which your abstract spotlights as "the
  frontier." Suggesting the head of that lab to review a paper that praises its system is an
  independence problem. Recommend **not** listing him.
- **Yuke Zhu** (UT Austin + part-time NVIDIA) is the natural benchmark/LIBERO reviewer for the
  weights pole, but the NVIDIA appointment is the same GEAR/ASPIRE orbit. List only if you are
  comfortable with that tie; otherwise use Wang (already in the slate) for the weights pole.
- **Chelsea Finn** (Stanford; co-founder, Physical Intelligence) is a top VLA reviewer (Octo), but
  Physical Intelligence's pi0 is a surveyed method and she has RT-X co-authorships that may overlap
  your author set. Verify before listing.

## Clean alternates (swap in if you need more or hit a personal COI)

- **Deepak Pathak** (CMU) - cross-embodiment transfer + self-supervised skills.
- **Abhishek Gupta** (Univ. of Washington) - unsupervised skill discovery / RL.
- **Osbert Bastani** (UPenn) - program synthesis bridging code-as-policy and reward-code (use as a
  substitute for Jayaraman, not in addition; same institution).
- **Dorsa Sadigh** (Stanford) - VLA + human-robot interaction (clean institution; her RT-H tie is no
  longer an author-institution COI now that no author is at DeepMind, but verify no personal
  co-authorship overlap).

## Explicitly EXCLUDED for conflict of interest (do not list)

- **Sergey Levine** (UC Berkeley) - author institution (Gaytri Jena is at Berkeley), and the
  most-entangled figure across RT-2 / Octo / OpenVLA / pi0.
- **Apple / Meta researchers** - now author-institution COI (Aman Chadha is at Apple, Vinija Jain at
  Meta). Screen the final list against both.
- **Karol Hausman** (Physical Intelligence) - method-authorship COI (direct author of RT-1/RT-2/pi0).
- **Direct authors of surveyed systems** (Code-as-Policies, RT-X, Octo, VoxPoser, etc.) -
  method-authorship COI, regardless of employer.

**Note on Google / DeepMind:** these are **no longer** author-institution COIs (the authors moved to
Meta and Apple), so a Google/DeepMind researcher is not conflicted *by institution*. But most
Google/DeepMind robotics researchers authored a surveyed system (RT-1/RT-2/RT-X/Octo, etc.), so they
remain excluded on **method-authorship** grounds. Net: this opens few new clean options there.
