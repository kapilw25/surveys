# Preprint submission kit (for a citable DOI while arXiv is closed to CS surveys)

> arXiv CS now blocks un-peer-reviewed surveys, so until a journal/conference accepts the paper,
> use a preprint server that still takes reviews. **I cannot submit this for you** (it needs your
> account and your agreement to the server's terms), so this file has everything ready to paste.
> **Upload file:** `weights-or-skills.pdf` (the 300 dpi, 1.3 MB named version; also live on the site).

## Which server (ranked for a robotics/ML survey)

1. **TechRxiv (IEEE):** best fit. Free, issues a Crossref DOI, IEEE-run so it is reputable and
   topically aligned with robotics, and it accepts reviews/surveys. Light scope/plagiarism screen,
   not peer review. → https://www.techrxiv.org/
2. **Zenodo (CERN)** or **OSF Preprints:** instant DOI, no content gate, any field. Lower ML-community
   discoverability than TechRxiv, but the fastest guaranteed DOI and good for a permanent timestamp.
   → https://zenodo.org/ · https://osf.io/preprints/
3. **Preprints.org (MDPI):** fast DOI, accepts surveys, but the MDPI association carries a mild
   prestige caveat. → https://www.preprints.org/
4. **SSRN (Elsevier):** works, but weaker fit (social-science/econ heavy) for a robotics survey.

**Recommended:** post to **TechRxiv** (DOI + reach + fit). Optionally also mint a **Zenodo** DOI for a
permanent archive. Both can coexist with a later journal publication.

**Abstract:**
Robot learning is splitting into two bets: policies that bake competence into frozen weights (vision-language-action, or VLA, models), and agents that write and refine their own executable skills as code. This survey organises the field around that axis of weights versus skills. Its central analytical contribution is a deep-dive that arranges code-as-policy methods by their degree of self-improvement, from zero-shot program synthesis, through closed-loop self-repair and persistent skill memory, to the sparsely populated cell in which execution feedback, skill memory, and evolutionary search combine into one open-ended loop; only a few very recent systems (for example ASPIRE, ENPIRE, and RoboClaw) occupy that cell. We map the complementary "skills" pole, from unsupervised reinforcement-learning skill discovery to large-language-model skill libraries, and show that the word "skill" is used in at least five distinct senses, of which only the code sense self-improves without gradient updates. We then connect the taxonomy to the emerging skill economy: commercial robot-skill marketplaces now distribute one-tap skills across robots but ship only static playback, which surfaces open problems of adaptation, cross-embodiment portability, provenance, safety verification, composition, and standardisation. This is a deliberately focused survey. Rather than cataloguing the field exhaustively, it examines 77 representative systems across six technique families through one taxonomy and a set of contrast tables, and it supplies operational definitions of the self-improvement mechanisms together with a statement of what each family cannot do.

## Steps (TechRxiv)

1. Create/sign in to a TechRxiv account (IEEE account works).
2. New submission, type = **Preprint**, article type **Review/Survey**.
3. Upload `weights-or-skills.pdf`.
4. Paste the Title, Authors + affiliations, Abstract, Keywords, and Category above; set corresponding author + email.
5. Pick the license (CC BY 4.0).
6. Submit. After the light scope/plagiarism screen (usually a few days), you get a **DOI** you can cite everywhere.

## One caution before you post publicly

A **named, public preprint can compromise a double-anonymous review.** TMLR and most conferences are
double-anonymous. Posting to a preprint server is generally allowed there (reviewers are told not to
actively search), but it de-anonymizes if a reviewer finds it. CSUR is single-anonymous, so it is a
non-issue there. Decide your target venue's blind model first; if you are going double-anonymous and
want to be strict, hold the public preprint until after submission or acceptance.
